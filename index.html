                <h2>
                  Make a plan
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The first step is to make a plan. This should be done with the help of the health care team and the person’s family or friends. The plan should include information on what kind of care the person needs, who will provide it, and how it will be paid for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The plan should also include information on how the person’s health care needs will be met in the event of an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second step is to find a provider who can provide the needed care. The provider may be a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional. The provider should be someone who is familiar with the person’s health condition and who can provide the type of care that is needed.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <img style="height: 400px; width: 400px; box-shadow: rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 8px 24px, rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 16px 56px, rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 24px 80px; border-radius: 35px;" src="https://cadiahealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thumbnail_gov-3.jpg" alt="Healthcare Maryland">

            </div>
            <p>
              The third step is to make sure that the provider is covered by the person’s insurance. If the provider is not covered by insurance, the person may have to pay for the care out of pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fourth step is to make sure that the provider is qualified to provide the care that is needed. The provider should be licensed by the state in which they practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fifth step is to make sure that the provider has the proper credentials. The provider should have completed a training program and passed an examination.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sixth step is to make sure that the provider is up to date on their vaccinations. The provider should also be up to date on their malpractice insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seventh step is to make sure that the provider is comfortable with the person’s family or friends. The provider should be able to answer any questions that they may have about the care that is needed.

              Choose a health care team
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
              It is important to choose a health care team that you trust and feel comfortable with. This team should be able to communicate well with each other and with you. They should also be able to provide the care that you need.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first step in choosing a health care team is to ask your family and friends for recommendations. You can also look online or on the yellow pages for doctors, clinics, or hospitals in your area. Once you have a list of potential providers, you can start to narrow down your choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are looking for a health care provider, it is important to consider their credentials. Make sure that they are licensed and accredited by the appropriate organizations. You should also make sure that they have experience treating patients with the same or similar conditions as you.

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    A support system can include family, friends, or community resources. This system can help with things like transportation, child care, and meal preparation. A support system can also provide emotional stability during difficult times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to finding a support system, it is important to consider what type of support you need. For example, if you are struggling with mental health issues, you might want to seek out a support group or therapy. If you are facing financial difficulties, you might want to seek out a financial advisor or budgeting assistance.
                  </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              Once you have considered what type of support you need, it is important to reach out to those who can provide it. If you are not sure where to start, there are many resources available online and in your community. You can also ask your doctor or mental health provider for recommendations.

              Learn about your medications

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
              Make sure you know what medications you are taking and why you are taking them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. It is important to take your medications exactly as prescribed. Do not skip doses or stop taking them without talking to your doctor first. Some conditions may get worse if the medication is stopped suddenly. Make sure you know how to store your medications and keep them out of the reach of children. Keep a list of all your medications with you, and share the list with your doctor and pharmacist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Medication errors can occur at any stage in the process of prescribing, dispensing, or taking medication. The best way to avoid medication errors is to be an active participant in your care.
